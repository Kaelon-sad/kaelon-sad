### üßë‚Äçüíª **About Me:**  

My story began in a small snowy town where technology seemed distant and inaccessible. Since childhood, I‚Äôve been a curious kid who took apart gadgets to understand how they worked. My first "victim" was an old TV that I accidentally broke while trying to connect a game console. But that didn‚Äôt stop me‚Äîit sparked my interest in tech and programming.  

In school, I started learning the basics of programming, first on an old Windows XP computer, and later on Linux, which I installed after a week of trial and error. That‚Äôs when I realized I wanted to dedicate my life to technology.  

When I moved to the capital to attend university, my world changed. Here, I met like-minded people who shared my passion for computers and cybersecurity. I began diving deeper into programming, learning Python, C++, and JavaScript, as well as mastering tools for vulnerability analysis and data protection.

### ‚òï **Coffee Quote:**  
*"Coffee isn‚Äôt just a drink‚Äîit‚Äôs fuel for ideas that change the world. Every cup is a new bug to fix and a new code to write."*
